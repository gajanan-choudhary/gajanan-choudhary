- I am currently a software engineer in the [IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) team.
  I am absolutely killing it here, going to extreme lengths to deliver architectural, performance, and quality improvements to oneMKL on latest and future Intel CPUs and GPUs.
- I would love to hear from you by e-mail at gajananchoudhary91@gmail.com.
- There is a long list of HPC production software I have worked on over the last decade, including but not limited to:
    * [IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html),
    * [UXL Foundation](https://uxlfoundation.org/)'s open-source [oneMath Library](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneMath) (formerly oneMKL Interfaces),
    * CFD software, [AdH](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476708/adaptive-hydraulics-model-system/), [ADCIRC](http://adcirc.org/) (Fortran), and [GSSHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSSHA), and
    * My own open-source software, [Water Coupler](http://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/water-coupler), that couples AdH, ADCIRC, and GSSHA through their Python interfaces (that I created) for compound flooding simulations.
- Your options to understand my profile:
    * [Two-page-rÃ©sume (recommended)](https://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume/releases/download/v1.6.0/two-page-resume.pdf),
    * [One-page-rÃ©sume](https://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume/releases/download/v1.6.0/one-page-resume.pdf),
    * [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume/releases/download/v1.6.0/CV.pdf), and/or
    * [Markdown/plain-text CV](https://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume).
- Fun fact: Somewhere in my genealogy of PhD advisors lie some of the greatest mathematicians that have ever lived -- Lagrange, Laplace, and Euler, to name a few. You can take a look at my math genealogy through the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=261723).
