### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**gajanan-choudhary/gajanan-choudhary** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

- I would love to hear from you by e-mail at gajanan@utexas.edu.
- My plain-text CV is available in my GitHub repository, [gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume-text](https://github.com/gajanan-choudhary/CV-Resume-text).
- Ask me about how to optimize your Python software using C, C++, and Fortran functions with it. Also ask me about the Water Coupler.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving `htopy`, a software I created for automating generation of Python/ctypes wrappers of C and C++ software.
- Iâ€™m currently working on wrapping C, C++, and Fortran software into Python (think: NumPy) for modernizing them and using them with Python's rich library ecosystem. For instance, I have wrapped a hurricane simulation HPC software, ADCIRC (Fortran), and a flood simulation software, GSSHA (C++), into Python to couple them together for simulation of compound floods from hurricanes, such as that observed during Hurricane Harvey (2017).
- Fun fact: Somewhere in my genealogy (of PhD advisors) lie some of the greatest mathematicians that have ever lived -- Lagrange, Laplace, and Euler, to name a few. You can take a look at my math genealogy through the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=261723).
